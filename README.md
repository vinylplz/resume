# resume
Greg Forties latest resume: [here][latest resume]


# Overview
This repo serves as a place to get a copy of my [latest resume] in multiple formats, as well as an example of how to automate any task using [fabric] and [travis-ci].  It relies on the [pandoc] command line utility for doing the actual document conversion from [markdown](./greg_forties_resume.md) to various other formats.

# Workflow
The basic workflow looks like this:

1. edit the main [markdown] file
2. convert it to various formats with `fab build`
3. check the converted files in build/ to make sure they are what you want
4. commit your changes back to github (.gitignore excludes build/ artifacts)  
  * triggers an [automated travis build](https://travis-ci.org/vinylplz/resume)
5. if everything still looks good, tag your commit and `push --tags` to github  
  * triggers another travis build AND creates a [release][latest resume] on githib using the [travis github release provider](http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/releases/)
6. enjoy not having to edit dozens of files
